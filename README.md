## End to End Data Science Projects
### 1. Customer Churn in Banking using Neural Network
#### Developed a predictive model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to identify customers likely tochurn in a banking environment.
#### Conducted data cleaning, feature engineering, and label encoding to prepare high-dimensional input.
#### Designed and trained a feedforward ANN using TensorFlow/Keras, optimizing activation functions and learning rates and created a consulting-style PPT outlining key insights, model performance, and strategic business actions.
